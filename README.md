### Bugs ###

Assuming that property names and values in README.md needs to be tested against the values which are returned as result:

1. "subject" values from the README.md don't exist on the server
2. When Query include "properties" all objects are returned, regarding the given "properties" (Test: postQuerySubjectsProperties)
3. Metadata is returning additional properties: "url", "ticker", "decimals", "policy", "logo"
4. Metadata is missing "preImage" property (Test: getMetadataVerifyProperties)
5. For the property "name" there is a difference in following properties:
   * "signatures" and "anSignatures" value ((Test: getMetadataVerifyProperties))
   * There is additional "sequenceNumber" property (in all objects)
